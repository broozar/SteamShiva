- Get the Steamworks SDK from https://partner.steamgames.com
- Extract the content into the Plugins\com.shaderman.steamworks\Sources\Steamworks_SDK folder

Windows:
- open the plugion sln file in VS2015
- build as RELEASE in 32 and 64 bit

Linux:
- build using the gear icon inside ShiVa 2.0
- if you have multilib or ia32 installed, ShiVa will detect it and make both 32 and 64bit libraries
- direct makefile build not recommended

Mac 32 bit:
- CURRENTLY NOT UPDATED OLD INFO FOLLOWING
- Do not use the "Generate X-code project" option in the editor, this will destroy the correctly configured project file.
- Copy the com.shaderman.steamworks folder to Mac and open the xcode project in Make\Mac folder
- Build for 32-bit
- The result will be a newly built library: Contents\Mac\Steamworks_Mac.dylib
- In Shiva windows, in the mac section of the plugin, import the plugin binary and select the dylib that was generated.
- Now you can export the project for Mac
- If you are testing on the Mac and not through steam, after you build the project in the UAT, you'll need to create a steam_appid.txt in the program [Name].App/Contents/MacOS/ folder

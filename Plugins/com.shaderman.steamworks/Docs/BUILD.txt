- Get the Steamworks SDK from https://partner.steamgames.com
- Extract the content sdk\public\steaminto into Plugins\com.shaderman.steamworks\Sources\steam

Windows 32/64:
- open the plugion sln file in VS2015 or later
- build as RELEASE in 32 and 64 bit

Linux 64:
- do not build inside ShiVa 2.0 as this will change the custom makefile!
- command line: make TARGET_ARCH=X86_64 -f /path/to/Plugins/com.shaderman.steamworks/Make/Linux/Steamworks.makefile
- change TARGET_ARCH variable if you need a 32bit build
- after game is exported: open the "data" folder of the exported game and copy Plugins\com.shaderman.steamworks\Frameworks\Linux\x86_64\lib\libsteam_api.so into the folder
- also create a file named "steam_appid.txt", containing only the number of your game's steam app ID (example game: 480), in the data folder

Mac 32:
- support removed
